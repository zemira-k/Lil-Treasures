# Lil'Treasures: Educational projects for stay-at-home kids

An MVP service concept, that provides fun & educational materials for children who are staying at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, based on a one time order or a monthly subscription.

This concept was created as part of a Code Jam collaboration of Practicum's Web-Development & UI/UX Design students from Russia, Israel & USA.
